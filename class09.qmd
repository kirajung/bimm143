## Question 1.
The percentage of structures in the PDB solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy is 93.0%. 

```{r}
pdb_X.ray <- gsub(",", "", pdb$X.ray)
pdb_EM <- gsub(",", "", pdb$EM)
pdb_Total <- gsub(",", "", pdb$Total)
(sum(as.numeric(pdb_X.ray)) + sum(as.numeric(pdb_EM))) / sum(as.numeric(pdb_Total))
```

## Question 2.
The proportion of structures in the PDB that are protein is 86.8%

```{r}
as.numeric(pdb_Total[1]) / sum(as.numeric(pdb_Total))
```

## Question 3.
There are 1,294 structures 

## PDB format
